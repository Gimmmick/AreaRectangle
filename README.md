Chapter 6, Programming Challenge 2

The program will ask the user to enter the width and length of a rectangle, and then display the rectangle’s area. The program calls the following methods:
•	 getLength—This method should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s length, and then
return that value as a double.
•	 getWidth—This method should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s width, and then
return that value as a double.
•	 getArea—This method should accept the rectangle’s length and width as arguments, and
return the rectangle’s area. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.
•	 displayData—This method should accept the rectangle’s length, width, and area as
arguments, and display them in an appropriate message on the screen.
